ctri - "Circle TRIangle"
Animation to demonstrate how an inscribed regular polygon can come close to forming a circle as its sides approach infinity.

Usage:
ctri [flags [values]]
Options:
    -help                 Prints this message and exits
    --pwidth   [number]   Change the line width of the polygon
    --cwidth   [number]   Change the line width of the circle
    --cres     [integer]  Change the resolution of the circle (how many triangles)
    --interval [number]   Change the number to seconds to wait untl the next frame (animation)
    --pmax     [integer]  Change the number of sides at which the animation will reset
    --pstart   [integer]  Change the starting side count of the polygon (does not effect `--pmax`)
    --samples  [integer]  Change the number of samples to take when doing multisampling (higher values result in smoother graphics)
    -step                 Change the animation to instead add a side when the SPACEBAR is pressed. Causes `--interval` to have to effect.

number: A float
integer: An int. You can prefix with "0x" for hexidecimal and "0" for octal
