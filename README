ctri - "Circle TRIangle"
Animation to demonstrate how an inscribed or circumscribed regular
polygon can come close to forming a circle as its sides approach
infinity.

Usage:
ctri [flags [values]]
Options:
    -help                 Prints this message and exits
    --pwidth   [number]   Change the line width of the polygon
    --cwidth   [number]   Change the line width of the circle
    --cres     [integer]  Change the resolution of the circle (how
                          many triangles)
    --interval [number]   Change the number to seconds to wait untl
                          the next frame (animation)
    --pmax     [integer]  Change the number of sides at which the
                          animation will reset
    --pstart   [integer]  Change the starting side count of the
                          polygon (does not effect `--pmax`)
    --samples  [integer]  Change the number of samples to take when
                          doing multisampling (higher values result
                          in smoother graphics)
    --cscale  [number]    Sets the scale of the animation 
    -step                 Change the animation to instead add a side
                          when the SPACEBAR is pressed. Causes
                          `--interval` to have to effect.
    -cscribe              Show a circumscribed polygon instead of an
                          inscribed one

number:  A float
integer: An int. You can prefix with "0x" for hexidecimal and "0" for
         octal
